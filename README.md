===============

## text translation

To start translating text, go to our [text database](https://tra:vame4uFA@tra.cloudant.com/rfm_loc/_design/rfm_loc/index.html#) and select your locale.

Text is arranged in bins by content area. Once you've edited and saved some text you can view it live on our test server:

	https://bhq-play-test.herokuapp.com/default/start?locale={YOUR_LOCALE}&override_locale={YOUR_LOCALE}
	
Note that your locale appears twice in the url, once to specify the (pre-built) localized version and again to load the fresh text you've edited.

## stimulus adaptation

Many exercises can be localized completely by editing the text for your locale; others need different levels of custom stimulus. We can disable selected exercises for your locale until they have been fully localized.
